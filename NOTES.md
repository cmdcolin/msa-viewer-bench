## Notes

- CDN which was heavily relied on, making project mostly dead
- Linked project (plotly react-msa-viewer) also dead (404 github)
- Source code needs manual editing for it to work (xref
  https://github.com/wilzbach/msa/issues/257)
- But, the library is overall a good reference for canvas based rendering. Has
  many "MSA application features" that are of general interest to bioinformatics
  researchers e.g. consensus, selection, labels
